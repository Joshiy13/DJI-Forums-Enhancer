# DJI Forums Enhancer

This is a firefox extension to enhance the experience when using the DJI Forums. It aims to add Quality of Life features, that the DJI staff team doesn't want to add or didn't add yet.
We will **NEVER** collect any data about our users, which is why we dont obfuscate our code and have everything open source.

Current features:
- Convert the "Flight distance" shown on the DJI Forums from ft to km
